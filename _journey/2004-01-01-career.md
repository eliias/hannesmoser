### <small class="text-muted">2004 – 2013</small>Early career

#### Game Developer

In my first full-time role at [PICS](https://www.pics.co.at/) and
[elements](https://elements.at/), I developed online games in Flash. This
involved creating various innovative technical solutions, including
side-scrollers, Mario Kart-like racing games, isometric 2.5D puzzle games, and
much more.

solutions, I began as a full stack developer and quickly progressed to the lead
developer role in my second year. During my tenure, I was responsible for the
conceptualization, development, and maintenance of two large-scale websites, an
asset management system, and various system-critical infrastructure. I also
hired, built, and led a team of three developers.

My first experience as a lecturer and coach began at WIFI, one of Austria’s
leading adult education institutes. Hired as a contractor for the Advertising
Academy (WDA) course program, I taught Flash and web development. This
experience ignited my passion for teaching, and I later expanded my courses to
include web design and web development.
