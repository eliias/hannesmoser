At Shopify, I co-founded and led the core team that built the foundational
infrastructure for the company’s large-scale search and recommender systems.
The project—internally known as Disco—originated within Shopify’s
“New Capabilities” program, an internal incubator where small teams of engineers
were empowered to pursue bold, high-impact ideas without permission.

We developed streaming pipelines, feature stores, and internal tooling to
support ML-driven ranking and retrieval. Our system architecture reduced
indexing times from multiple weeks to under an hour—transforming the pace and
flexibility of experimentation across product search and personalization.

Within Shopify’s Core Foundations group, I contributed to the team that
implemented Single Sign-On (SSO) across all Shopify stores. We migrated from a
one-email-per-shop model to a unified identity system without downtime or
merchant disruption—an effort that required backwards-compatible changes,
and tight coordination across services. A (now abandoned) patent was filed for
our approach to backfilling authentication data with minimal UX friction: [US20200349620A1](https://patents.google.com/patent/US20200349620A1/en).
