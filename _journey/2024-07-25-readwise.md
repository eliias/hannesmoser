### <small class="text-muted">2023 – now</small>Staff Engineer

[![Readwise](/assets/pages/home/readwise.png)](https://readwise.io/reader)

At Readwise, I develop AI-driven products that enhance reading experiences. My
work centers on natural language processing—combining classical algorithms,
machine learning, and large language models to build systems that interpret and
generate human language. The goal: smarter, more intuitive reading tools.
