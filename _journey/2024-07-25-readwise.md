[![Readwise](/assets/pages/home/readwise.png)](https://readwise.io/reader)

At Readwise, I specialize in developing AI-driven products to enhance reading
experiences. My work focuses on tackling text and natural language processing
challenges, leveraging a combination of classic computer science techniques,
machine learning, and large language models. This involves creating and
optimizing algorithms that understand, interpret, and generate human language,
ultimately improving the functionality and user experience of our apps and
software.
