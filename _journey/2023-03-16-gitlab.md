### <small class="text-muted">2022 – 2023</small>Staff Engineer

[![GitLab](/assets/pages/home/gitlab.svg)](https://gitlab.com/)

At GitLab, I was part of the Incubation Engineering team—a small, experimental
group reporting directly to the CEO. Each member explored high-impact product
ideas; my focus was real-time collaboration.

I built a CRDT library for Ruby on  top of the Rust-based yrs lib, enabling
multiplayer editing through custom Redis and ActionCable adapters. Throughout
the project, I collaborated closely with the open source y-crdt collective,
including Kevin Jahns (author of the YATA CRDT paper) and Bartosz Sypytkowski,
contributing improvements and deepening integration between the Rust and Ruby
ecosystems.
