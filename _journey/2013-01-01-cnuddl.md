I cofounded and developed the pet sitting platform “cnuddl”. We were part of the
academic founders program [BCCS (Business Creation Center Salzburg GmbH)](http://www.bccs.at/) and
pitched the project on [ national television](https://www.puls4.com/2-minuten-2-millionen/staffel-2/videos/Beitraege/Cnuddl-im-2-Millionen-Pitch).

#### About

**cnuddl** was a comprehensive web application designed to cater to pets and
their owners. We aimed to solve a common problem for pet owners: the stress-free
search for reliable pet sitters.

**cnuddl** connected pet sitters with pet owners, allowing them to easily find
and book trusted sitters in their neighborhood. Customers could also select
add-on packages such as additional insurance and pick-up services, and complete
their payment directly on the platform.
