I develop and architect web applications, services, and databases for a diverse
set of clients and consult with companies on creating and optimizing software
development processes.

This work includes architectural decisions, coaching
and mentoring engineering teams and engineers, designing release processes,
and consulting leadership.

My previous experience includes working with startups, as well as large tech
companies.
I have helped these companies build and scale from their first user to millions.

I cofounded and developed the pet sitting platform "cnuddl". We were part of the
academic founders program [BCCS](http://www.bccs.at/) (Business Creation Center
Salzburg GmbH) and pitched the project
on [national television](https://www.puls4.com/2-minuten-2-millionen/staffel-2/videos/Beitraege/Cnuddl-im-2-Millionen-Pitch).

#### About

cnuddl is a web application. We place and provide full services for pets and
their owners. cnuddl solves one of every pet owner's problems: stress-free
finding of nice pet sitter for your pet. cnuddl connects pet sitters with our
customers, the pet owners. Our customers can search for pet sitters in their
neighborhood independently, book an add-on package (additional insurance,
pick-up service) and pay directly on the platform.

Uncomplicated, quick and all in one place.
