## Ace of Mace

Commissioned by spice company Wiberg, this classic game of dexterity may
literally be too hot to handle. Manipulate the hand to flip the piece of mace
into the empty glass, skilfully judging angles and velocities.

Advancing through five stages of ever increasing difficulty, the player
surmounts obstacles of chilli peppers  fruit and kitchen utensils, while the
music drives an atmosphere of relaxed endeavour. Brilliant high definition
images, a responsive physics engine, and a highly intuitive interface create an
outstanding gaming experience.
