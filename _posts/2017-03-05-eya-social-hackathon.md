Over the weekend, me and my team attended the [EYA Social Hackathon 2017](https://eu-youthaward.org/social-hackathon-2017/).
I'd like to post our result, cause I really like our idea and concept.

> We love food and friends and therefore we need to create the ultimate tool to combine the best of both worlds.
dumpster chef is an adventurous journey and your chance to make new friends and the world a better place by opposing
the throw-away society.

Yesterday, we had to present our results at the [SN Saal](http://www.salzburg.com/nachrichten/unternehmen/wir-ueber-uns/sn/artikel/sn-saal-ihre-veranstaltung-in-modernem-rahmen-1503/)
in Salzburg. There is also a video with our presentation.
